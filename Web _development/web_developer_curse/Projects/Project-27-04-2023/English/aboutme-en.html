        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>
          Nádia, I was born in 2007 and I live in the beautiful city of Porto,
          Portugal. I'm a student athlete, at the moment I'm at the end of my
          10th year, in the language and humanities course and I play Volleyball
          at Leixões Sport Club for the cadet and youth levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my parents, I have an older brother who I take as a
          inspiration for my life, he was always very dedicated and hardworking
          to achieve what he wanted for his life, he is the person I take always
          in consideration that it helps me when I have certain doubts or even
          choices and need advice.
        </p>
        <p>
          People tend to characterize me as a very communicative person,
          friendly, committed to the realization of my plans, works and dreams
        </p>
        <p>
          How do I characterize myself? - As a dreamer, hard worker,
          perfectionist, cheerful but like all of us I also have my flaws among
          them stubbornness, being very detail-oriented and a little impatient,
          but thanks to volleyball I was able to start working on some of these
          small flaws like the patience we have during a game or training
          session to maintain so that we can maintain a good pace of play and
          thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a person who always likes to be doing something, not even that is
          minimal, that's why I'm a very active person, I really like chat, with
          friends or family, I listen to music of various genres a lot, I love
          meeting other musical types, reading is one of my things favorite
          things to do when I have time and it helps me a lot when it comes to
          concentration and learning, I especially like to read about novel,
          fiction, but also informative books about sport or day to day issues.
